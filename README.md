# ForEST
ForEST is a domain-specific language that adds parallel spatio-temporal computing to Python.  It is designed FOR Expressing Spatial-Temporal (FOREST) computation using a combination of primitives and patterns.

## Getting back from the whiteboard
We took a brief break from developing the ForEST code to work on the theoretical foundations of the language. We are excited to announce that we made some incredible breakthroughs during this period. We now have a solid theoretical model that was inspired by the earlier ForEST work. In the next few months we will start a redesign of ForEST to align with this new theoretical model. In the spirit of reproducible science we will also begin creating a number of examples to demonstrate how the theory operates using the ForEST language itself that anyone can reproduce using Jupyter Notebooks. Stay tuned as we transfer our whiteboard results to back to this public github space.
